# Learning-Web-Dev
This Repository of my website development learning tasks from my UDEMY Web Development Course.
More files will be commited to the repository as i complete more tasks in my studies.

Currently my focus is learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript to be able to make the most basic of websites and springboard into other languages as they become relevant.


Current Tasks:
